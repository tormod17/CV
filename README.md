## Why I am a Developer?

Whilst delving into various pursuits I have always had a keen interest in the web and building websites/apps. This finally pushed me into pursuing my interest further and undertaking an online course in front end development and then enrolling in the Founders & Coder's Academy. This has been life changing and since opened the door to a world I have fallen in love with. The opportunity to work through problems collaboratively to come up with a tangible final product I find extremely rewarding. Web development has a never ending spiral of continuous learning, the fast paced ever changing environment provides rich rewards and excitement.
